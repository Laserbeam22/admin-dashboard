# admin-dashboard
Intermediate HTML &amp; CSS project

In this project, I was encouraged to lean mainly on grid for my layout. Although I would have personally chosen grid & flex together, I took this as a challenge to learn and better understand grid specifically. This project helped me to see all the ways I can implement grid where I might not have thought otherwise. I was also able to see where flex might be an easier choice, as well.
